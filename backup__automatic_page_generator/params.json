{"name":"RPerl","tagline":"A Low-Magic Perl 5 Optimizing Compiler","body":"The RPerl Compiler\r\n=====\r\n\r\nRPerl is an implementation of the Perl 11 philosophy (perl11.org) in the form of an optimizing Perl 5 compiler.\r\n\r\nRPerl translates a low-magic subset of the Perl 5 language into equivalent C/C++ code utilizing Perl data structures, capable of being called directly from Perl 5 code using the Inline::C and Inline::CPP modules.  Any existing C/C++ compiler may be used to compile and optimize the resulting C/C++ code.\r\n\r\nRPerl follows the naming convention of RPython, in that each implements a restricted sub-set of their respective parent language, thus RPerl stands for Restricted Perl.  It is hoped that RPerl will also eventually come to stand for Revolutionary Perl. \r\n\r\nThe RPerl development board may be found on Trello here:\r\n\r\nhttps://trello.com/board/austin-pm-rperl-development/51b6b97215f60f9460006538\r\n\r\nThe RPerl source code repository may be found on Github here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/wbraswell/rperl/\r\n\r\nRPerl is copyright (c) 2013, William N.
