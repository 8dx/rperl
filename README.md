RPerl
=====

RPerl is a computer programming language, based on the popular Perl 5 programming language. RPerl gives software developers a compiler to make their apps run really fast on parallel computing platforms like multi-core processors, the cloud, clusters, and supercomputers. RPerl stands for Restricted Perl, in that we restrict our use of Perl to those parts which can be made to run fast. RPerl also stands for Revolutionary Perl, in that we hope RPerl's speed will revolutionize the software development industry. RPerl might even stand for Roadrunner Perl, in that it RUNS REALLY FAST.

Normal computer users will like running RPerl apps because it will empower them to finally take full advantage of all their shiny, new multi-core processors and cloud accounts. Software developers will like programming in RPerl because it will automatically parallelize their applications to be compatible with current and future high-performance computing platforms.

The input to the RPerl compiler is low-magic Perl 5 source code. RPerl converts the low-magic Perl 5 source code into C++ source code using Perl and/or C++ data structures. Inline::CPP converts the C++ source code into XS source code. Perl's XS tools and a standard C++ compiler convert the XS source code into machine-readable binary code, which can be directly linked back into normal high-magic Perl 5 source code. The output of the RPerl compiler is fast-running binary code that is exactly equivalent to, and compatible with, the original low-magic Perl 5 source code input. The net effect is that RPerl compiles slow low-magic Perl 5 code into fast binary code, which can optionally be mixed back into high-magic Perl apps.
